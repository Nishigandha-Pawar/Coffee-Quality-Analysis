## ‚òï Welcome to Coffee Quality Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI project explores global coffee quality through interactive visualizations, using real-world data sourced from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI). It dives into the key cupping attributes that define premium coffee, helping uncover trends, patterns, and insights across origins, processing methods, and cup scores. Coffee isn't just a beverage ‚Äî it's a story of regions, flavors, methods, and craftsmanship. This Power BI project brews together the aroma of data and the flavor of insights to uncover what makes a perfect cup ‚Äî or what causes a defect.

From bean color and processing style to region-specific trends, this dashboard-driven project helps stakeholders in the coffee industry make data-backed decisions and discover the hidden patterns in their beans.

## üß© Problem Statement

Coffee producers, exporters, and quality analysts face challenges in maintaining consistent bean quality, identifying defect trends, and making data-backed decisions on processing methods, sourcing regions, and flavor profiles. Without a centralized visual analysis, stakeholders struggle to:

- Detect quality degradation across harvest years.
- Compare processing methods (e.g., washed vs natural).
- Trace defects by bean color, region, or grading date.
- Align production to market-demanded flavor and aroma profiles.
- Monitor partner-wise quality contributions.

This project provides a centralized Power BI dashboard to solve these challenges with visual analytics and drill-down capabilities.
